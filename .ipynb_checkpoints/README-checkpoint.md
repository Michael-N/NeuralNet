- Description:  Now that I have begun research in Multiagent Systems and Deep Reinforcement Learning I
                wish to experiment with some neural networks for classifying the MNIST handwriting dataset first.
                I have saved a personal copy of the old code that was in this repo and git retains the version
                history. This will be an 'evolution' of the project to do more than what the previous repo had.
